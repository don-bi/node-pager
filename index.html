            <h3>History</h3>
            <div class="text">
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript is compiled in browsers by a JS engine. There are many such as V8 and Spidermonkey, but V8 is the most popular engine and is used by chrome.</li>
                    <li>Since V8 was a super fast engine, people used it to create a runtime environment for JS, which is <span class="node">Node</span>.</li>
                    <li><span class="node">Node</span> <b><i>isn't</i></b> a programming language, nor a framework, it’s a <b>runtime environment</b> for JS.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Asynchronous Nature</h3>
            <div class="text">
                <ul>
                    <li>Allows tasks to be run simultaneously without waiting for one to end before commencing another.</li>
                    <li>If <span class="node">Node</span> receives another event while one is running, it sends it to another worker thread to perform the new process.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Event-Driven Nature</h3>
            <div class="text">
                <ul>
                    <li>When an event is triggered in <span class="node">Node</span>, a callback function (just calling  another function) occurs in response to that event.</li>
                    <li>This is so useful because they require significantly less resources than normal functions since they aren’t called when <span class="node">Node</span> first sees it, but once an event happens some point in the future.</li>
                    <li>Takes much less of a toll on the CPU.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>WHat ARE MODULES?</h3>
            <div class="text">
                <ul>
                    <li>Modules are similar to Python and Java libraries, and they basically contain different built-in functions of those modules that could be used after calling them.</li>
                    <li>The syntax to call them is by setting a variable to require the module.</li>
                    <li>const express = require('express');</li>
                </ul>
